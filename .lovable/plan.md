## Part 2: Marketing Plan

### Scenario A -- Free Marketing Only

**Channels (all free):**

1. **SEO / Content Marketing** -- You already have a knowledge base with 25+ articles and a blog. Publish 2-3 SEO-optimized articles per week using your own tools (great proof of concept). Target long-tail keywords like "best free AI email generator," "how to humanize AI content," "amazon affiliate review template."

2. **Social Media (organic)** -- Post daily on Twitter/X, LinkedIn, and one short-form video platform (TikTok or YouTube Shorts). Use your Social Media Suite to create the content. Share before/after examples, tips, and tool demos.

3. **Reddit and Quora** -- Answer questions about AI writing, content creation, and affiliate marketing. Link to your tool where relevant (not spammy -- genuinely helpful answers).

4. **Facebook Groups and Communities** -- Join 5-10 groups for bloggers, affiliate marketers, email marketers, and freelance writers. Share value first, mention the tool naturally.

5. **Product Hunt Launch** -- Free to submit. Can drive 500-2,000 signups in a single day if executed well.

6. **Cold Outreach via Email** -- Build a small list of bloggers and freelancers; offer free Pro trials in exchange for honest reviews/testimonials.

### Scenario B -- Paid Ads ($20/week starting budget)

**Platform:** Facebook/Instagram Ads (best for low budgets with broad targeting)

**Ad Strategy:**
- Lead with a short video demo (15-30 seconds) showing the tool in action
- Target: Content creators, bloggers, freelance writers, small business owners, affiliate marketers
- Start with 2-3 ad variations, kill underperformers after 3 days
- Optimize for signups (free trial or free plan registration)
- Expected cost per signup: $1.50-$3.00 at this budget level
- Expected trial-to-paid conversion: 10-15%

Note: By month 6-7 you will want to diversify into Google Ads and YouTube ads as you scale past $500/month in ad spend.

---

### Combined Strategy (Recommended)

Do both simultaneously. Free marketing builds your SEO foundation (which compounds over time), while paid ads drive immediate signups.

```text
Month  | Free Signups | Paid Signups | New Paid | Total Paid | MRR
-------|-------------|-------------|----------|------------|------
Feb    |     30      |     20      |     3    |      3     |   $75
Mar    |     60      |     50      |     7    |      9     |  $222
Apr    |    100      |    100      |    12    |     19     |  $475
May    |    150      |    180      |    20    |     36     |  $895
Jun    |    220      |    300      |    31    |     61     |$1,520
Jul    |    300      |    500      |    48    |    100     |$2,490
Aug    |    400      |    800      |    72    |    156     |$3,885
Sep    |    500      |   1200      |   102    |    233     |$5,805
```

**Time to $5,000 MRR with combined approach: ~8 months (around October 2025)**

## Part 4: What Needs to Be Built

To implement this pricing model on the existing site, here is what would need to be added:

1. **Stripe integration** for payment processing and subscription management
2. **User tiers database table** to track plan level (free/pro/business) and trial status
3. **Feature gating logic** throughout the dashboard to lock/unlock tools based on plan
4. **Word count tracking** per user per month with reset logic
5. **7-day trial logic** with automatic downgrade to free after expiration
6. **Updated Pricing page** with the new tiers, trial buttons, and feature comparison table
7. **Stripe webhook edge function** to handle subscription events (created, canceled, renewed)
8. **Dashboard billing section** in the profile page showing plan, usage, and upgrade/downgrade options
